# CRUNA documentation

CRUNA is an (aero)acoustic solver that can find, reconstruct, or optimize sound sources with impedance boundary conditions. The solver utilizes adjoint-based optimization techniques and includes the full non-linear Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in a finite-difference time-domain approach.
